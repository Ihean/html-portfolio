<h1>Superb Animes to watch on crunchyroll</h1>
<h2>Here are my three favorite picks.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Eminence in Shadow</h3>
<p> One of the best anime I've ever seen, without a doubt. Good fighting and martial arts execution, nice plot, humorously sarcastic.</p>
<h3>The Devil is a Part-Timer!</h3>
<p>I simply enjoy watching this anime. since watching this anime will pique your interest greatly. The best episodes are all available. This has romance, fantasy, comedy, and action. And the author's creativity and storyline may wow you.</p>
<h3>Classroom of the Elite</h3>
<p>What a display! It's difficult to put into words a work of art like this, but I tried, and I believe you should too. It completely differs in content from anything you have seen or read before and stands out. And it has an incredible lead, who is my third favourite lead of all time (after The Eminence in Shadow and The Devil is a Part-Timer)!</p>
